# r3s: Remote Rhein Ruhr Stage

The Remote-Rhein-Ruhr-Stage is a real-world stage in Monheim near DÃ¼sseldorf for the virtual congress rC3 this year.
We enable live streaming of talks and workshops for everyone.

## Why?
Sadly, due to the current situation, there will be no Chaos Communication Congress this year. In it's stead there
will be the "Remote Chaos Experience(rC3)" with many opportunities to participate. For participation we offer a stage,
so anyone interested can give a talk or workshop without having to set-up additional equipment.
