# r3s on the rC3: Call for Participation/People/Ideas 
The Remote-Rhein-Ruhr-Stage is a professional stage for everyone that offers physical space at the 
virtual Congress for people, projects, groups and communities. This year there will be no congress 
as we have known it in the past years. Instead, there will be a distributed event, with many 
opportunities to participate remotely.

And participation is the keyword. To fill the days between Christmas and New Year with excitement 
we are looking for your ideas! Let's do crazy things, with less wood and B1, but with more cyberspace.

Conceivable are on the one hand classic lectures for which we provide you with the appropriate 
equipment, but also discussion rounds or panels up to completely new formats, e.g. in the form of 
workshops, in which the participants can even take part at home.

## What we offer
* __Stage:__ We plan to offer a real stage without audience, with professional equipment and active 
  support for streaming. (If you can't be on site, you may also get advice and tips for a streaming setup 
  from home, so you can record or give talks from home).
* __Workshop Area:__ We want to create a workshop area where people watch you remotely. For this purpose 
  we offer a workshop table which is also filmed in close-up "from above". Depending on your plans, viewers 
  can watch from home and work on a project with you together.
* __Podium:__ We offer a platform for remote discussion rounds and panels.

## Thoughts on formats. Be creative!
* What formats do you know for conducting virtual/remote workshops with others?
* What can you do remotely that you could not do at the congress?
* Do you know any online games where you can join in or just watch?
* Do you have ideas like "Yoga workshop - exercise together" or "Bob Ross - painting together" that can be 
  implemented or even extended?
* What have you always wanted to use a virtual congress for?

The following information about your proposal or idea is helpful:

* What is your approximate idea? (Rough concept, objectives, number of participants, setup, preparation, 
  participants, etc.)
* What technology is required?
* What are the requirements for participants?
* What does it cost?

At the moment we are mainly looking for ideas for formats or possibilities to move in the digital space. 
For concrete suggestions such as talks, workshops, parties, idea implementation, there is the possibility to 
register and submit them at https://pretalx.r3s.nrw . If you would like to help us with the organisation, network 
your assembly with us or simply share information, you will soon find our organising meeting dates on our 
website https://r3s.nrw.

Kind regards  
the r3s organisation comitee.
