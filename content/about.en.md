# About us
The Remote-Rhein-Ruhr Stage is a real, real stage at the “Remote Congress”.
It is for all groups, institutions and individuals who want to connect live with all other individuals on the rC3. This year everything is different and we will not meet analogously on the actual "37c3" but virtually on the rC3. In this context, we would like to offer everyone in the region a stage to get in touch with others in #Neuland - the r3s.

The r3s is located in the southern Mettmann district in the beautiful town of Monheim am Rhein. This lies between the two major cities of Düsseldorf and Cologne.
We have organized a professional stage in the large hall of the VHS through the youth and cultural institution [Sojus7] (https://www.sojus.de).  
Here you can give presentations as if you were on the "right" C3. We also have a maker stage in a second room. 
Of course we will pay attention to all hygiene rules.  
This means in particular: All speakers are very welcome **IF** these people have registered with us beforehand 
**and have received confirmation from us**. 
The number of people in the room will be strictly regulated and entry will be controlled. So unfortunately a "pack meeting / uncontrolled gathering of people" is safe.

The program is planned and published in our [Pretalx] (https://pretalx.r3s.nrw/r3s/).
You can also submit submissions there. The virtual participation is of course possible for everyone and takes place within the framework of the rC3.
