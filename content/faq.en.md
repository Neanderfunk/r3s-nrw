# FAQ

## Who is the r3s for?
The r3s is aimed at all groups, institutions and individuals who interact live or via time-shift with this year's [Remote Chaos Experience (rC3)] (https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3- remote-chaos-experience /) want to connect.

## Why r3s at all?
r3s is our abbreviation for "Remote Rhein Ruhr Stage". Others claim it is called "Rhein-Ruhr-Rur-Stage". In both cases, r3s is easier to remember as a domain name.

## How can I participate?
There are many ways you can help. Here are a few ideas of what you can do
* Take part in our [Call for Participation / People / Ideas] (https://pretalx.r3s.nrw/r3s/)
* Collect ideas how you can take part in the rC3 as an assembly alone or with friends.
* need a lot of helpers, both on site in Monheim and for things that can be done remotely. You can find our unicorn system here: https://einhorn.r3s.nrw
  
  ** come to our mumble meetings! **

## Can I come by on site?
Due to the corona requirements, large gatherings are prohibited.

* If the audience is allowed, we will announce this in advance and control it by issuing tickets.
* Helpers need a shift in the [unicorn system] (https://einhorn.r3s.nrw/)

  ** Under no circumstances can you come by spontaneously. **

## How do you work together and where do you prepare?
 * We meet regularly via [mumble] (https://mumble.freifunk.net) on the freifunk.net server
 * A lot is going on in this [Telegram group] (https://t.me/RemoteRheinRuhrStage)
 * There are also a few mailing lists, write to us. Our email address is [orga@r3s.nrw] (mailto: orga@r3s.nrw)
 * Communication via [RocketChat] (http://rocket.events.ccc.de) is also possible, but it is not our primary internal medium
 * IRC, Mastodon, Signal, Twitter have some on the team

## Where is the r3s? Why Monheim?
With the [Sojus7] (https://www.sojus.de) there were already contacts to the free radio operators from "Neanderfunk"

* the adult education center Monheim has a spacious auditorium in which a draft can be ventilated.
* Courses are currently being held in the building subject to corona requirements; So there is an established concept (which we adapt of course)
* The VHS is not occupied over the Christmas holidays and we can spread out very airily with around a dozen people and use the escape routes to enable the speakers to walk without encountering them.
* The Soyuz team not only supports us on site with people, but also with event material.
* Monheim is not a big city, so the prognosis for the “Corona situation” tends to be better.
* The location in a high-rise estate from the 1970s ensures inexpensive local supplies with reasonably relaxed opening times. The ambience of the environment feels a little like [Eidelstädter Bürgerhaus] (https://www.hamburg.de/kulturzentren/13752216/eidelstedter-buergerhaus/) - the elderly will remember.

## Where is that and how should I get there?
[Monheim] (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monheim_am_Rhein) is a city of 40k people and lies on the right bank of the Rhine between Cologne and Düsseldorf.
[Directions] (/ anfahrt)

* We will take care of one way or another so that your talk doesn't fail in the last few kilometers.
* We will provide some form of shuttle service at least to the Langenfeld S-Bahn station during off-peak times.

## I have an idea!
Great, just bring it on! For all of us this is the first remote congress and we want to make it at least as cool as face-to-face congresses.

## I don't want to go online with a picture
If you want to hold a workshop / talk without your face on the net: Only “hands + slides” is possible.

## Who are you?
We are people who, in recent years at the Congress, e.g. at [OpenInfrastructureOrbit (OIO)] (http://oio.social) were active, in Erfa circles in e.g. [CCCAC] (https://aachen.ccc.de), [Chaospott] (https://chaospott.de/) or at [Freifunk] (http://www.freifunk.net) in [Neanderland] (https : //www.neanderfunk.de/) are.

## Information about the rC3
For the r3s organization team, too, this is #new territory in a way. In addition to the technical challenges that we will master, an event in which one can participate remotely also offers opportunities:

  * People who might otherwise not have received a ticket or could not afford one can take part.
  * People from other countries / continents can take part. In other years the journey to Germany may have been too far for them or even denied them.
  * Time that we have invested in building our habitat can now be used to prepare content.

## unicorn? and not angel system?
The reasons for choosing the name [unicorn system] (https://einhorn.r3s.nrw/) are unclear. We are happy with the name.

## What do you work with?
We use the toolchain that has proven itself in a chaos environment

   * [Pretalx] (https://pretalx.com/p/about/)
   * [Engelsystem] (https://engelsystem.de/)
   * [Pretix] (https://pretix.eu/)
   * [Etherpad] (https://yopad.eu/)

   * [Infobeamer] (https://info-beamer.com/)

   In addition:
    
   * The mail system runs on [Mailcow] (https://mailcow.email/).
   * According to the current status, the video production will take place via [OBS] (https://obsproject.com/).
